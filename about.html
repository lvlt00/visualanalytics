            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This project was created by me, Laura Virginia Licata Tiso, as my project in the class of Kay Schröder at the University of Applied Sciences in Düsseldorf in the summer semester of 2024. The data I have used for my visualizations is from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). I decided to use this data set because I believe that mental health needs a lot more transparent conversation without false hesitations; I thought removing stigmata around medication by talking more about it is a good first step. </p>
